        <p>Hi, I'm Marilyn. I am currently attending the Denver University Coding Boot Camp and look forward to using
            the skills I learn throughout this course to become a successful developer. I remember getting my first
            computer in elementary school, I was the only one on my block to have one. It was a Macintosh, and all I
            remember is playing Super Munchers and Dr. Brain on it. After being a part of the coding boot camp, I can
            truly appreciate how significant of an advancement these programs were then, and even more how the
            possibilities are truly limitless!c
        </p>

        <p>When I am not studying or working on homework, you can find me at a coffee shop or a table-top game store. I
            also like venturing around Denver in search of the perfect food spot.Care to join me in a delicious lunch
            and game of Ticket to Ride? I love driving with my windows down, music turned up loud, on the highway late
            at night, but at the same time I enjoy cozy nights in curled up
            with the latest crime fiction book or on my computer playing World of Warcraft. </p>
        <p>I believe that I am capable of achieving my goal to become a web developer. I believe in hard work, being a
            team player, continual learning and the willingness to go above and beyond.</p>
